How answer you that?</br></b><b><b>SNOUT</b><br>By'r lakin, a parlous fear.</br></b><b><b>STARVELING</b><br>I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.</br></b><b><b>BOTTOM</b><br>Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.</br><br>Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to</br><br>say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that</br><br>Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more</br><br>better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not</br><br>Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them</br><br>out of fear.</br></b><b><b>QUINCE</b><br>Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be</br><br>written in eight and six.</br></b><b><b>BOTTOM</b><br>No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.</br></b><b><b>SNOUT</b><br>Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?</br></b><b><b>STARVELING</b><br>I fear it, I promise you.</br></b><b><b>BOTTOM</b><br>Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to</br><br>bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a</br><br>most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful</br><br>wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to</br><br>look to 't.</br></b><b><b>SNOUT</b><br>Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.</br></b><b><b>BOTTOM</b><br>Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must</br><br>be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself</br><br>must speak through, saying thus, or to the same</br><br>defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish</br><br>You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would</br><br>entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life</br><br>for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it</br><br>were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a</br><br>man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name</br><br>his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.</br></b><b><b>QUINCE</b><br>Well it shall be so.

Then, there is</br><br>another thing: we must have a wall in the great</br><br>chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did</br><br>talk through the chink of a wall.</br></b><b><b>SNOUT</b><br>You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?</br></b><b><b>BOTTOM</b><br>Some man or other must present Wall: and let him</br><br>have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast</br><br>about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his</br><br>fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus</br><br>and Thisby whisper.</br></b><b><b>QUINCE</b><br>If that may be, then all is well.

A good moral, my lord: it is not</br><br>enough to speak, but to speak true.</br></b><b><b>HIPPOLYTA</b><br>Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child</br><br>on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.</br></b><b><b>THESEUS</b><br>His speech, was like a tangled chain; nothing</br><br>impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?</br></b><b><b>Prologue</b><br>Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;</br><br>But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.</br><br>This man is Pyramus, if you would know;</br><br>This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.</br><br>This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present</br><br>Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;</br><br>And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content</br><br>To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.</br><br>This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,</br><br>Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,</br><br>By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn</br><br>To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.</br><br>This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,</br><br>The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,</br><br>Did scare away, or rather did affright;</br><br>And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,</br><br>Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.</br><br>Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,</br><br>And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:</br><br>Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,</br><br>He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;</br><br>And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,</br><br>His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,</br><br>Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain</br><br>At large discourse, while here they do remain.</br></b><b><b>THESEUS</b><br>I wonder if the lion be to speak.</br></b><b><b>DEMETRIUS</b><br>No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.</br></b><b><b>Wall</b><br>In this same interlude it doth befall</br><br>That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;</br><br>And such a wall, as I would have you think,</br><br>That had in it a crannied hole or chink,</br><br>Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,</br><br>Did whisper often very secretly.</br><br>This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show</br><br>That I am that same wall; the truth is so:</br><br>And this the cranny is, right and sinister,</br><br>Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.</br></b><b><b>THESEUS</b><br>Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?</br></b><b><b>DEMETRIUS</b><br>It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard</br><br>discourse, my lord.</br></b><b><b>THESEUS</b><br>Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!</br></b><b><b>Pyramus</b><br>O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!</br><br>O night, which ever art when day is not!</br><br>O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,</br><br>I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!</br><br>And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,</br><br>That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!</br><br>Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,</br><br>Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!</br><br>Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!</br><br>But what see I?

'Deceiving me'</br><br>is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to</br><br>spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will</br><br>fall pat as I told you.

Here</br><br>come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.</br></b><b><b>Lion</b><br>You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear</br><br>The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,</br><br>May now perchance both quake and tremble here,</br><br>When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.</br><br>Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am</br><br>A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;</br><br>For, if I should as lion come in strife</br><br>Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.</br></b><b><b>THESEUS</b><br>A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.</br></b><b><b>DEMETRIUS</b><br>The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.</br></b><b><b>LYSANDER</b><br>This lion is a very fox for his valour.</br></b><b><b>THESEUS</b><br>True; and a goose for his discretion.</br></b><b><b>DEMETRIUS</b><br>Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his</br><br>discretion; and the fox carries the goose.</br></b><b><b>THESEUS</b><br>His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;</br><br>for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:</br><br>leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.</br></b><b><b>Moonshine</b><br>This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;--</br></b><b><b>DEMETRIUS</b><br>He should have worn the horns on his head.</br></b><b><b>THESEUS</b><br>He is no crescent, and his horns are</br><br>invisible within the circumference.</br></b><b><b>Moonshine</b><br>This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;</br><br>Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.</br></b><b><b>THESEUS</b><br>This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man</br><br>should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the</br><br>man i' the moon?</br></b><b><b>DEMETRIUS</b><br>He dares not come there for the candle; for, you</br><br>see, it is already in snuff.</br></b><b><b>HIPPOLYTA</b><br>I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!</br></b><b><b>THESEUS</b><br>It appears, by his small light of discretion, that</br><br>he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all</br><br>reason, we must stay the time.</br></b><b><b>LYSANDER</b><br>Proceed, Moon.</br></b><b><b>Moonshine</b><br>All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the</br><br>lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this</br><br>thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.</br></b><b><b>DEMETRIUS</b><br>Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all</br><br>these are in the moon.
